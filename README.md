# Topo-Feature-Extract
This repository started with a [Jupyter project notebook](project.ipynb) which studied classification of land types from EOS SAT Sentinel 2A imagery with random forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (CART) and other methods. QGIS software is used to generate training data for the classifier.
