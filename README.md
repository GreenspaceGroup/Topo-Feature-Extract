# Topo-Feature-Extract
This repository started by building upon the methodology of an [Jupyter project notebook](project.ipynb) which studied classification of land types from the [EOS SAT](https://eos.com/eossat/) satellite imagery available from [Sentinel 2A](https://eos.com/find-satellite/sentinel-2/) [launched as part of the European Commissionâ€™s Copernicus program on June 23, 2015]. A variety of [machine learning algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050922021159) were used which included [random forest](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-random-forest), [Support Vector Machine (SVM)](https://github.com/topics/support-vector-machines?o=desc&s=forks), [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/topics/naive-bayes?o=desc&s=forks), [Decision Tree](https://github.com/topics/decision-tree?o=desc&s=forks) [CART](https://github.com/search?q=decision+tree+CART&type=repositories&s=forks&o=desc) and other [machine learning algorithms for classification purposes](https://github.com/search?q=Machine+Learning+Algorithms+for+Classification+Purpose&type=repositories&s=forks&o=desc). [QGIS software](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/) is used to generate training data for the classifier.
